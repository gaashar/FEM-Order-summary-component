## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Started with this simple project to get started with to develop my CSS skills.
I already learned about the properties and had theoretical knowledge of concepts like Flexbox, Media queries to build a responsive UI.

I never worked with SVGs before, so in this project I learned how to position them using background property. Positioning SVGs were one of the challenging part of this project.

This is the first time I created an responsive UI, using media queries and glad that worked.
I am pretty confident to pick-up next projects.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I would like to improve my CSS skills more, and have to try out different ways of positioning using flexbox and grids in future.
My main focus is to build a muscle memory of the basics and to learn from my challenges, as much as I can
